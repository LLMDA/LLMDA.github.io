            Open-source code is pervasive. In this setting, embedded vulnerabilities are spreading to downstream software at an alarming rate. While such vulnerabilities are generally identified and addressed rapidly, inconsistent maintenance policies may lead security patches to go unnoticed. Indeed, security patches can be {\em silent}, i.e., they do not always come with comprehensive advisories such as CVEs. This lack of transparency leaves users oblivious to available security updates, providing ample opportunity for attackers to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. Consequently, identifying silent security patches just in time when they are released is essential for preventing n-day attacks, and for ensuring robust and secure maintenance practices. With <strong>LLMDA</strong> we propose to (1) leverage large language models (LLMs) to augment patch information with generated code change explanations, (2) design a representation learning approach that explores code-text alignment methodologies for feature combination, (3) implement a label-wise training with labeled instructions for guiding the embedding based on security relevance, and (4) rely on a probabilistic batch contrastive learning mechanism for building a high-precision identifier of security patches. We evaluate <strong>LLMDA</strong> on the PatchDB and SPI-DB literature datasets and show that our approach substantially improves over the state-of-the-art, notably GraphSPD by 20% in terms of F-Measure on the SPI-DB benchmark.

            Figure 1 depicts the overview of the different steps of LLMDA. First, representations of multi-modal inputs (code and texts) are obtained using LLMs. Then, the obtained representations are aligned within a unique embedding space and fused into a single comprehensive representation by the <strong>PT-Former</strong> module. Finally, a stochastic batch contrastive learning (<strong>SBCL</strong>) mechanism is deployed to make the predictions of whether a given patch is a security patch or not.

            <strong>PT-Former</strong> innovatively addresses the challenge of fusing embeddings from different modalities—specifically, patches and texts—by introducing an architecture that aligns and concatenates embedding spaces to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of classification models. Leveraging self-attention mechanisms, PT-Former updates individual embeddings, ensuring that the information carried by each is rich and contextually relevant. The cross-attention module further aligns the embeddings of code changes with their textual explanations, creating a nuanced understanding of the interaction between these two modalities. Finally, by employing feed-forward layers for non-linear transformation and concatenating the aligned embeddings, <strong>PT-Former</strong> achieves a comprehensive representation of the input data. This methodical approach not only bridges the gap between distinct feature spaces but also optimizes the process of embedding fusion, thereby enabling more accurate and insightful classification outcomes.

            <strong>SBCL</strong>, standing for Stochastic Batch Contrastive Learning, serves as a sophisticated mechanism for refining the classification capabilities of a binary classifier tasked with distinguishing security patches from non-security patches. This mechanism operates on the premise of enhancing the classifier's ability to discern intrinsic patterns within a dataset, relying on embeddings output by PT-Former that encapsulate security patch characteristics along with their LLM-generated explanations, developer descriptions, and labelled instructions. <strong>SBCL</strong> innovatively utilizes batch sampling and triplet formation techniques to emphasize learning from both closely related security examples (positive pairs) and distinguishably different non-security examples (negative pairs), thereby optimizing the model's embedding space for precise security relevance prediction. Through the application of a stochastic batch contrastive loss, <strong>SBCL</strong> meticulously adjusts the embedding distances within each batch to ensure a clear demarcation between security-related and non-security-related examples. This strategic approach significantly bolsters the model's performance by fostering an embedding space that is both robust and discriminative, thereby setting a new standard for the identification of security patches.

            Despite the capability of LMMs in identifying and describing the next action to complete the given task in natural language, it is still challenging to convert the action description into an executable action within the environment.
            To address the challenge of action grounding, we explore three approaches using different types of information: Grounding via Element Attributes, Grounding via Textual Choices, and Grounding via Image Annotation.

            <li><strong>LLMDA</strong>: is a novel framework for security patch detection. LLMDA can detect silent security patches as it does not require any explicit descriptive information from developers to operate. It leverages LLMs for both data augmentation (generation of explanations) and patch analysis (generation of representations). It further deploys a specialized <strong>PT-Former</strong> module to align various modalities within a single embedding space, enabling the approach to extract richer information from the joint context of code and descriptions. Leveraging contrastive learning on the yielded embeddings, LLMDA is able to precisely identify security patches.</li>
            <li>We achieve new state-of-the-art performance in security patch detection. The experimental results show that our language-centric approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods (i.e., <strong>TwinRNN and GraphSPD</strong>) on two target datasets (i.e., PatchDB and SPI-DB): LLMDA achieves up to ~42% and ~20% performance improvement over the incumbent state-of-the-art on both datasets, respectively.</li>
            <li>We experimentally demonstrate through ablation studies that the different components and key design decisions of LLMDA are contributing to its overall performance. Notably, we show that the representations have a high discriminative power and that the yielded classification model is relatively robust (compared to the incumbent state-of-the-art)</li>

		  <p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
          <p>
            <li><strong>RQ1.</strong> How effective is LLMDA in identifying security patches? We assess LLMDA against well-known literature benchmarks and compare the achieved performance against some strong baselines.</li>
			<li><strong>RQ2.</strong> How do key design decisions in LLMDA contribute to its performance? We perform an ablation study where we investigate the added value of label-wise training, the generated explanations, PT-Former and contrastive learning.  </li>
			<li><strong>RQ3.</strong> To what extent the distribution of patch representations in LLMDA improves over the state of the art? We visualize the learned representations from LLMDA and GraphSPD to observe the differences in their potential discriminative power. Based on case studies, we also qualitatively assess how LLMDA representation assigns scores to key tokens.  </li>
			<li><strong>RQ4.</strong> Does the trained LLMDA model generalize beyond our study dataset? We evaluate the robustness of LLMDA by applying the model trained on a given dataset to samples from a different dataset.  </li>

random patches from our PatchDB dataset. We then collect
their associated embeddings from LLMDA and GraphSPD and
apply principal component analysis (PCA) [30]. Given the
imbalance of the dataset, the drawn samples are largely non-
security patches, while security patches are fewer. Figure 5
presents the PCA visualizations of the representations. We observe from the distribution of data points that LLMDA
can effectively separate the two categories (i.e., security and
non-security patches), in contrast to the incumbent state-of-
the-art, GraphSPD. This finding suggests that the representa-
tions of LLMDA are highly relevant for the task of security
patch detection.</p>

              		<p> Table VI presents 2 examples to illustrate
the difference between LLMDA and GraphSPD in terms of
what the representations can capture, and potentially explaining why LLMDA was successful on these cases while
GraphSPD was not. For our classification task, we have two
labels: security (0) and non-security (1). For LLMDA, we can
directly consider the label name in the instruction. Thus we
compute the attention map between security and the tokens in
the patch, the explanation, and the description. For GraphSPD,
however, since there no real label name involved in the training
and inference phases, we compute the attention score between
the words in the patch and the number “0” or “1”. To simplify
the analysis, we only highlight, in Table VI, tokens for which
the similarity score is higher than 0.5. As shown in the examples, LLMDA generally assigns high
similarity scores to security-related aspects, suggesting a detection capability that nuances between tokens. For example,
in the sgminer.c patch, LLMDA gives high scores to realloc
and mutex init, indicating a finer sensitivity to potential security implications within these code parts. Similarly, in the
krb5/auth context.c patch, the use of memset for initializing
authenticator memory is scored high in LLMDA, reflecting its
more acute recognition of security practices.</p>
